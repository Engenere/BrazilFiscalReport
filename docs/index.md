# Brazil Fiscal Report

Python library for generating Brazilian auxiliary fiscal documents in PDF from XML documents.

## Supported Documents üìÑ

- **DANFE** - Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletr√¥nica (NF-e)
- **DACCe** - Documento Auxiliar da Carta de Corre√ß√£o Eletr√¥nica (CC-e)
- **DACTE** - Documento Auxiliar do Conhecimento de Transporte Eletr√¥nico (CT-e)
- **DAMDFE** - Documento Auxiliar do Manifesto Eletr√¥nico de Documentos Fiscais (MDF-e)

## Usage Modes

### 1. CLI (Command Line)

For quick and easy PDF generation, use the CLI. After configuring the `config.yaml` file with the issuer details, margins, and logo, you can easily generate PDFs with a single command.

### 2. Python Code

For further customization and integration, use the library directly in Python code. This mode allows you to configure margins, fonts, receipt positions, and other options tailored to your needs.
